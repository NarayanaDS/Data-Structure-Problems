Write a function that takes an unsigned integer and return the number of '1' bits it has (also known as the Hamming weight).


class Solution(object):
    def hammingWeight(self, n):
        """
        :type n: int
        :rtype: int
        """
        result = 0
        
        while n:
            result += 1
            n = n & n-1
        
        return result
